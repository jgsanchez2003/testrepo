## Load Census Tract Shapes and Shelter Locations
We load the shelter data and the ACS tract shapefiles for Alameda, Santa Clara, and San Francisco counties and filter the tracts that fall within the boundaries of Oakland, San Jose, and San Francisco. (note: this code snippet was provided by Jose)

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

## Convert CRS to be consistent
```{r, message=F, warning=F, comment=NA, echo=T}

  mutate(centroid = st_centroid(geometry))

# Compute distance matrix (shelters Ã— centroids) in meters
distance_matrix <- st_distance(shelters, city_shapes$centroid)

# Find the index of the closest centroid for each shelter
closest_centroid_index <- apply(distance_matrix, 1, which.min)

# Extract the corresponding minimum distance (in meters)
closest_distance <- apply(distance_matrix, 1, min)

# Add the closest centroid and distance as new columns in the shelters dataset
shelters <- shelters %>%
  mutate(
    closest_centroid_id = city_shapes$GEOID[closest_centroid_index],  # Assign the GEOID of the closest tract
    min_distance_meters = closest_distance  # Store the minimum distance
  )


```


## View Census Tracts on Map
